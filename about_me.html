<h1>About Me</h1>

<br>

<h2><p class=" IntroText">I like to game, listen to music and watch loads of TV shows and movies.
 I do love to travel and have travelled as far west as California and as far east as New Zealand.
        I haven't been to every country inbetween but that would be the dream to be able to achieve that and more.
    </p></h2>

<p class="psn">Games that I'm playing regularly right now are Dead By Daylight, Rocket League, Horizon Forbidden West and Fortnite now and again.
I have recently started to replay through Batmman: Arkham Knight after 7 years. I will play through God of War soon after that.

<p class="Music"> Music that I like to listen to the most is Trance, as I find the melodies of that genre very relaxing and easy to listen to. I listen to the discover weekly section that is provided by Spotify and the suggestions they give are really good, most of the time. I usually listen to Spotify through my PlayStation while playing Rocket League as their music isn't always good.
<br><br>
A little tip for people who play on PlayStation, you can get Spotify Premium features while listening through the Playstation.

<p class=" TV">I love a good movie and TV series that I can get lost in with characters I can relate to and watch develop overr the course of thier story.
    <br><br>
     The Rookie is a TV show I'm watching currently, among others, that stars Nanthan Fillion, who is a great actor and the show is so funny and heartwarming with really good drama.</p>
